## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: SwiftUI + Swift 6, CoreData (not SwiftData), Supabase, OpenAI GPT-4o/mini, Mux HLS, RevenueCat SDK 5.x
- Phase 1 must include video content licensing as a parallel track — it gates Phase 2 and everything downstream
- All OpenAI calls must proxy through Supabase Edge Functions — never from iOS client directly
- AI safety guardrails (system prompt rules) must be established in Phase 1 before any user-facing AI is live

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Video content sourcing timeline is unknown — must be resolved before Phase 2 can complete; see SUMMARY.md gaps
- Subscription pricing not yet set — unit economics model (Apple 30% cut + AI cost + margin) must be run before Phase 7 planning
